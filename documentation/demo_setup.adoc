= Lab Environment & Resources

== Lab Environment
This lab utilizes Red Hat Product Demo System (RHPDS) to provision the lab environment.
RHPDS  uses Red Hat CloudForms to deploy infrastructure needed for our lab. +

The infrastructure consists of 5 VMs as well as the overall network configuration. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 has already been deployed for this lab.

OpenShift environment for this lab consists of the following systems:

== Demo Resources

The primary source of content for this lab is the industry 4.0 demo project repository.

*Project location:* link:https://github.com/redhat-iot/industry-4.0-demo[https://github.com/redhat-iot/industry-4.0-demo]

The repository contains the following resources:

* *Dashboard* (`dashboard`): Dashboard is an Angular.js app running on a Node.js runtime, along with JBoss Data Grid and a Data Grid proxy component that properly handles browser-based REST requests and relays to JBoss Data Grid via the Hotrod protocol.
* *Gateway* (`gateway`): Device connectivity, edge processing and machine learning execution. Contains JBOSS AMQ and JBOSS Fuse.
* *Bridge* (`imqtt-to-kafka-bridge`): Bridge between MQTT and Kafka, implemented using Camel MQTT and Kafka components. MQTT Topic names are mapped as message keys in Kafka.
* *OpenShift* (`openshift`): Templates for deploying the following applications on OpenShift: dashboard, EC/kapua
* *IoT Data* (`iot_data`): Dataset of machine runtime
* *Simulator* (`simulator`): Simulated software sensor generating IoT Data
